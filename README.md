# wiot-360-assessment

## Getting Started

#### 1. Installation

```
npm i
```

#### 2. Running in dev

```
npm run dev
```

## Factors Considered

#### - Data is auto generated, so it won't look accurate physically as auto generation can cause the vehicles to be in the sea

#### - Did not apply responsiveness to mobile as this dashboard does not seem like something to be used on a phone

## Future Improvements If Provided the Time

#### - Add test cases for both components

#### - Have E2E test case for when user click on a row in the table

#### Have unit tests for the helper functions in utils
